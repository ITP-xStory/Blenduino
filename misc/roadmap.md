# Roadmap

## Create example tutorials
Now that the basic functionality is working, I'd like to get people using Blenduino! I aim to create a simple video walkthrough for getting data from Arduino to Blender, from Blender to Arduino, and then both.

## Create physical animation robot
Using 3D printed parts and a few potentiometers, I will demonstrate a potential use case for Blenduino. A complex, nonhumanoid creature can be intuitively and quickly animated by printing out a physical representation and moving joints around in physical space.

## Add datablock linking in Blenduino UI panel
As of now Blenduino exposes the incoming Serial data to Blender's Scene datablock. I'd like to see if I can expose this to the UI panel of the plugin, perhaps as a driver, so that users don't have to dig deep into Blender's interface to use the incoming data.

## Update plugin for Blender 2.8
Given the imminent release of Blender 2.8, I'd like to spend a bit of time updateing the plugin to work with the new API.

## Past updates

### January 2019 Update
Happy New Year, and great news for the Blenduino project: Blenduino has been accepted into a program at ITP called xStory, which is intended to foster development of tools for experimental storytelling. After a brief hiatus for the winter break I'll be continuing work on Blenduino. The first thing on the agenda is to create another roadmap, one that spans 2019. Please feel free to [reach out](https://jameshosken.com/contact/) or open an issue if you have and questions, thoughts, or ideas!
